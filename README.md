# 🛠️ Collaborative Open-Source Development of Process Safety Analysis Tools  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository is dedicated to the **open-source development of process safety analysis tools**, enabling engineers and researchers to assess, mitigate, and prevent industrial hazards. The project leverages **Python-based simulations, risk assessment models, and automation tools** to enhance safety in **chemical, manufacturing, and industrial operations**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ **Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment** – Implements methods like **HAZOP, LOPA, and FMEA** for process risk evaluation.  
- ✅ **Consequence Modeling** – Simulates **fire, explosion, and toxic release** scenarios for hazard analysis.  
- ✅ **Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA)** – Utilizes probabilistic models to estimate **risk exposure and mitigation strategies**.  
- ✅ **Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection** – Integrates AI-driven **early warning systems** for process deviations.  
- ✅ **Regulatory Compliance Tools** – Assists in adhering to **OSHA PSM, EPA RMP, and international safety standards**.  

## 🔍 Use Cases  
- **Process Safety Engineering** – Designing safer industrial processes by analyzing **failure scenarios**.  
- **Incident Investigation & Prevention** – Identifying root causes of **process safety incidents** and implementing corrective actions.  
- **Regulatory Compliance & Auditing** – Automating documentation for **safety regulations and industry best practices**.  
- **Training & Simulation** – Providing interactive safety training for **engineers and operators**.
